# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?

- I feel moderately confident about the `each` method. I understand what it does, I guess I just don't really understand the use cases at the moment.

1. This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?

- I feel like it accurately simulated what it's going to be like in the field. I'm not going to have everything at my fingertips, so it's good to get practice on where I can look for reliable info. 

1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

- I need more practice with how the different methods interact with eachother. This was my first tme using 2 methods in the same iteration and it was cool to see how they interacted.

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

- again, no questions at the moment. As time goes on, and I see iterations used in actual projects, I'll have more questions.
